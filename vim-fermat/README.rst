Potato Colors
=============

My own personal vim colorscheme.

Potato supports 256-color terminals in addition to the gui.

You can get a taste of potato from `vimcolors.com <http://vimcolors.com/916/potato/dark>`_.
For some reason some of the highlighting is broken on vimcolors though,
most notably the Todo.  In real life the Todo is bold and italic yellow.
